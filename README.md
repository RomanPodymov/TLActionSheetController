# TLActionSheetController

This aims to be a suitable replacement for UIAlertController's action sheet style.

## Why?

UIAlertController's action sheet is extremely limited without the use of private APIs.
It is not possible to adjust the colour of labels, add icons, add a custom header view, etc.
This replacement aims to solve all of those issues, whilst maintain the same look and feel.
